# VersionIt

VersionIt is a simple versioning helper inspired by the ultra useful `npm version` command.  It performs two functions:

- updates any `.json` files in the current working directory with the updated version
- tags the version control used in the cwd with the updated version

To get started with VersionIt, first install it:

```
[sudo] npm install -g versionit
```

Once installed, you should be able to access the `versionit` command from in a terminal window.
